# COMS4170_Final
Flight deck

My Contributions:

Quiz) Worked on the technical implementation (add logic to count correct answers). Added to the multiple choice questions and modified quiz prompt (counting score and formatting) so it's aligned with the overall design specifications.
Web app) Imported and created functionality for interactive videos for multiple lessons (VSI, altimeter etc). Added images supporting each lesson.
